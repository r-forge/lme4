Good statistical practice suggests that we should not only provide
estimates of the parameters in a model but also provide a measure of
the precision of these estimates, typically in the form of a standard
error of the estimate.  Such a summary is meaningful if the estimator
is on a scale where an interval that is symmetric about the estimate
would be a suitable summary of the uncertainty.  A notable exception
to this practice of providing symmetric intervals is the confidence
interval on a population variance based on the $\chi^2$ distribution.
This interval recognizes that the distribution of the estimator of a
variance is quite asymmetric.  However, in much more complex models
using variance components or, more generally, linear mixed-effects
models most statistical software reverts to providing an estimate of a
variance component and a standard error of this estimate.  We discuss
why this is inappropriate and some alternatives based on profiling the
log-likelihood or using Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulation.
