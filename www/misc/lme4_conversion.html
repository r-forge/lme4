    >As previously announced on the mailing list, we will shortly be releasing a new version of <code
      >lme4</code
      >, a descendant of the previous development version <code
      >lme4Eigen</code
      >. For users who do not access any internal structures, there will be few backward-incompatible changes.</p

      >the version of <code
	>lme4</code
	> currently on R-forge (currently version 0.999902344-0, to be released as version 1.0 (!)) should be used for new projects</li
      ><li
      >The current CRAN version (0.999375-42) will be replaced by a nearly identical version called <code
	>lme4.0</code
	> (currently version 0.9999-2; the only backward-incompatible change in this version is a fix to the AGQ code contributed by Wayne Zhang). <code
	>lme4.0</code
	> is a maintenance version and will only be changed to fix documented bugs.</li

      >all other versions (<code
	>lme4a</code
	>, <code
	>lme4b</code

      >Because the internal computational machinery has changed, results from the newest version of <code
	>lme4</code
	> will not be numerically identical to those from previous versions. For reasonably well-defined fits, they will be extremely close (within numerical tolerances of 1e-4 or so), but for unstable or poorly-defined fits the results may change, and very unstable fits may fail when they (apparently) succeeded with previous versions. Similarly, some fits may be slower with the new version, although on average the new version should be faster and more stable. There are more numerical tuning options available than before (see below); non-default settings may restore the speed and/or ability to fit a particular model without an error.</li
