Martin Maechler:
    Both things I "think about" and things I'm  "convinced about"

* TODO Replace save() / load() *.rda  with  saveRDS() and readRDS()
* TODO As for the copula book, source("lMMwR-prelim.R") instead of
     cut'n'paste the same '<<preliminaries ..." in all *.Rnw s.
** TODO Make sure that the text *does* contain/show most of those preliminaries.

* TODO in ./ChTheory.Rnw much R code (in regular chunks) commented out;
   This has mostly happened in svn rev 940 with*OUT* any log message --- why ??

* TODO Should we create a small "companion package" with scripts and data sets

* DONE replaced 'lme4a' by 'lme4'
* DONE replaced all uses of <mod>@re@<comp> and <mod>@resp@<comp>
       by getME(<mod>, "<comp>")
