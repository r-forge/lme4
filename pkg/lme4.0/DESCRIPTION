Package: lme4.0
Version: 0.999999-4
Date: 2013-11-12
Title: Linear mixed-effects models using S4 classes
Description: Fit linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models.
   This is the implementation of lme4 available on CRAN and developed up to 2011.
   It has been renamed to lme4.0, and is now deprecated in favor of the new
   lme4 package, for everything new.
   For reproducibility of past research and data analysis, lme4.0 is kept
   available.  For the time being, code and other packages who have made
   extensive use of the inner structure, e.g., of lmer() results, will have
   to depend on lme4.0 until their code can be adapted.
