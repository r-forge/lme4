Package: lme4.0

Title: Linear mixed-effects models using S4 classes
Description: Fit linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models.
    This is the implementation of lme4 available on CRAN and developed up to 2011.
    It has been renamed to lme4.0, and is now deprecated in favor of the new lme4 package.
 For the time being, code and other packages who have made extensive use
    of the inner structure, e.g., of lmer() results, will have to depend on
    lme4.0 until their code can be adapted.
