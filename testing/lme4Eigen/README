This directory is intended for additional testing of lme4Eigen
(perhaps including comparisons with other package versions/packages),
with the specific goal of documenting the results of different
optimizers and combinations of tuning parameters on the results
of GLMMs.

Data structure for test results (subject to change) a list with
elements

 *  problem: data set (character: 'Contraception', 'cbpp', etc.)
 *  method: optimization f'n (character: 'bobyqa', 'nlminb', ...)
 *  optimx: is optimization run through optimx? (logical)
 *  options: optimization options (list: may be coerced to character)
 *  time: 
 *  parameters: numeric vector (varying length: may be coerced to character)
 *  deviance: numeric
 *  KKT
 *  bad: logical
 *  result: description (intended to be relatively free-form)

Files:

bobyqa1: Contraception data tests with bobyqa, varying rhobeg/rhoend/tolPwrss

bobyqa_problem1: demonstrating some kind of environment modification
  that screws up a second, identical bobyqa run after a preliminary
  failed one

coalition2: preliminary tests on a Gamma GLMM on the 'coalition2' data set from Zelig

testcbpp.R: preliminary tests on the CBPP data set

anal1.R: analysis code
