This directory is intended for additional testing, especially
comparisons of lme4 with other package versions/packages, with
the specific goal of documenting the results of different optimizers
and combinations of tuning parameters on the results of GLMMs.

Data structure for test results (subject to change): a list with
elements

 *  problem: data set (character: 'Contraception', 'cbpp', etc.)
 *  pkg: package used (lme4[|.0], glmmADMB, glmmML)
 *  method: optimization f'n (character: 'bobyqa', 'nlminb', ...)
 *  ## ?? optimx: is optimization run through optimx? (logical)
 *  options: optimization options (list: may be coerced to character)
 *  time: just elapsed time
 *  parameters: 
   * LIST possibly containing
     fixef
     ranef
     VarCorr
 *  deviance: numeric
 *  KKT
 *  bad: logical
 *  result: description (intended to be relatively free-form)
 *  AGQ:

Might be easier to store the fits themselves and post-process.
Problematic for large data sets, though. Also, it's a pain to have objects from many different types of fits all present at once, because there are a lot of conflicts among accessor methods ...

Alternatively, it might be easier to ram everything into a data frame in the first place.

MISC FILES
================
xapply.R
anal1.R
miscfuns.R

bobqya1_problem.R: demonstrating some kind of environment modification that screws up a second, identical bobyqa run after a preliminary failed one

PROBLEMS (should I organize everything into separate subdirectories ... ??)
==============

1. Contraception

* Contraception data tests with bobyqa, varying rhobeg/rhoend/tolPwrss

2. CBPP

Cbpp.R

 (bobyqa1: older version that required more internal messing around -- interface now improved?)

coalition2: preliminary tests on a Gamma GLMM on the 'coalition2' data set from Zelig
