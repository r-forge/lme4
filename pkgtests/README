directory with tools for checking downstream packages (of lme4,
but could in principle be something else??)

* set up all needed packages in a local ./library directory

* in order to check packages, we need a _tarball_ of the focal package
_and_ we need all of its dependencies and suggests to be installed locally;
we're going to do this by setting up a local ./library that can hold
all that junk so we don't end up installing 75% of CRAN in our own
local libraries ...

* need new code to handle 'package required and available but unsuitable version'
