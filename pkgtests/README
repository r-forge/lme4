This directory contains tools for checking downstream packages (of lme4, but could in principle be something else??)

* set up all needed packages in a local ./library directory
* in order to check packages, we need a _tarball_ of the focal package
_and_ we need all of its dependencies and suggests to be installed locally; we do this by setting up a local ./library that can hold all that junk so we don't end up installing 75% of CRAN in our own
local libraries ... and so that in principle it can be kept clean
* need new code to handle 'package required and available but unsuitable version'
* should consider updating to use the built-in R package management/comparison tools

* only two .R files:
 * lme4depfuns.R: utility functions
 * lme4deptests.R: driver code

* 'runtests' is a shell script with environment variable-setting commands that _must_ be run prior to testing (esp. setting up ~/.R/check.Renviron file properly); it seems necessary to set R_LIBS_SITE explicitly as well as within ~/.R/check.Renviron, but haven't tested this thoroughly, nor do I really understand what's going on.

* the process:

TO DO / FIXME:
* getting warnings about
  Warning in normalizePath(c(new, .Library.site, .Library), "/") :
     path[4]="./library": No such file or directory

not quite sure where this is coming from, whether it matters, and how to fix it
